# 🧠 Suicide Ideation Detection using NLP

A machine learning project focused on detecting suicide ideation in social media text using Natural Language Processing techniques. This project was developed as a **college assignment at Petra Christian University**, highlighting the use of text classification models for mental health support and analysis.

## 📚 Academic Context

This project was created as part of an academic assignment for the Text Web Mining course at Petra Christian University. It explores the use of traditional machine learning models for detecting suicidal thoughts in user-generated content.

---

## 📝 Overview

The goal of this project is to classify text data into three categories:
- **0**: Not suicidal
- **1**: Indication of suicidal
- **2**: Indication of hurting someone else

The classification is based on user comments or reviews, using preprocessed text features and trained ML models.

## 🚀 Features

- Data augmentation using LLM
- Preprocessing of raw text data (tokenization, cleaning, vectorization)
- Multi-class classification using traditional ML techniques
- Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
